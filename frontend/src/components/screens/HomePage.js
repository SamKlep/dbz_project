              <strong>Dragon Ball Z</strong> continues the adventures of Goku,
              who, along with his companions, defend the Earth against villains
              ranging from aliens (Frieza), androids (Cell) and magical
              creatures (Majin Buu). While the original Dragon Ball anime
              followed Goku from childhood to early adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is
              a continuation of his adult life, but at the same time parallels
              the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the development of his
              rival Vegeta.
